# Magna Coders – Build. Collaborate. Solve.

Magna Coders is a collaborative platform where developers, designers, and problem-solvers unite to showcase their skills, form teams, and create tech solutions for real-world challenges.

This project began with a simple idea:  
_“What if a group of people could come together, find a problem in society, and solve it with technology?”_  
Now, Magna Coders is evolving into a living ecosystem of skills, collaboration, and impact.
