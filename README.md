# Magna Coders – Build. Collaborate. Solve.  

Magna Coders is a collaborative platform where developers, designers, and problem-solvers unite to showcase their skills, form teams, and create tech solutions for real-world challenges.  

This project began with a simple idea:  
*“What if a group of people could come together, find a problem in society, and solve it with technology?”*  
Now, Magna Coders is evolving into a living ecosystem of skills, collaboration, and impact.
